# CSCI1430 ChromaGAN: Colorization of Images

For our final project, we implemented colorization based on *ChromaGAN: Adversarial Picture Colorization with Semantic Class Distribution* by Patricia Vitoria, Lara Raad, and Coloma Ballester.

## Running the Code

All the scripts can be found in <code>code</code>. To run a scirpt, go to the <code>code</code> directory and run it as a Python module. For example: 

```

```

All parameter settings can be found in <code>code/Utils.py</code> file.
